- To optimize, when a move is made, you only need to check locally to detect if the board now has a 4
    - For AI class, if a '4' is achieved, the tree stops, so you can implement it here as well. No new board will contain a 4 before a move is played.
- currently recursive and also builds a tree. Can this tree still be used and appended/updated in data (i.e. add two more layers and reiterate algorithm every AI move)
- can store board with booleans
