- To optimize, when a move is made, you only need to check locally to detect if the board now has a 4
    - For AI class, if a '4' is achieved, the tree stops, so you can implement it here as well. No new board will contain a 4 before a move is played.
- currently recursive and also builds a tree. Can this tree still be used and appended/updated in data (i.e. add two more layers and reiterate algorithm every AI move)
- can store board with booleans


- Re-do contains backslash to not call contains forward slash in vincentai (save space)
- consider passing pointer to grid from one position to its child at each step (save space) (all grids "owned" my youngest child)
- make more comments
- fix number of wins in vincentai (diagonals incorrect)
- later, allow user input of rows and columns for more interesting games
- change storage of board to booleans (save space)
- merge redwin and blackwin functions (save time)
- glitch somewhere

- change winner to get winner
- Make name a changeable field
- Make columns and rows changeable
- Untrack ConsoleCF?
- Make GUI better
- Get rid of consoleCF HumanAI
- Change board to booleans
