To Do:
- Re-do contains backslash to not call contains forward slash in vincentai (save space)
- consider passing pointer to grid from one position to its child at each step (save space) (all grids "owned" my youngest child)
- make more comments
- fix number of wins in vincentai (diagonals incorrect)
- change winner to get winner
- Make name a changeable field
- Change contains backslash function to not call forward slash
- Console CF AI vs Human is broken
- Check play function in CFGame Line 88 --> What if last play is a win? Is this a problem?
- Set Window size to that of screen by default?
